        <p>Panda,</p>
        <p>i hope this message makes you smile a little bigger so that i would be blessed to see that moment :)</p>
        <p>its been long na . . You know the world will always keep saying things.. but what really matters is " what do u think ? " Do you really think you're abnormal ? Nah.. You aren't abnormal. You are Just human.. may be a gifted one, from childhood everyone goes through this & shit. Many of them chooses to avod it while few accept it. No matter how the fate of one is ; There are people out there who keep loving and sharing kindness. And you are one of them.</p>
        <p>Love yourself the same way you love people.. Eat healthy , sleep well. . Choose you choices. be gentle to yourself. when i look back to the time you messaged me; ofcourse I never thought there would be someone like me in the world lol. you are more indeed. You have emotional quotient more than me. I ever said about you to my cousins. I mean how can some one so selfless ? The thing is focus on your self.. Go n study hard .. got exhausted / tale a small breaks by going out with friends and spending time with family. Do things that make you feel home.. Flaunt them.. Feel like the main character of your own life.</p>
        <p>Ever heard ? " you have to give it all ; To have it all" so go, get it man .. we all believe in you. If you ever get self doubts; share with me. I am here. inthakante em cheppanu.. you are your own friend and your own enemy.. the way you treat your heart, mind and body is the same way they work for you. SO BE GENTLE.</p>
        <p>I call you PANDA; not cause pandas are lazy... But pandas are the mosy lovely species I ever know till date.. they never harm anyone.. they do things to make others happy. species like pandas can't live in the wild; The same as You . So dear panda ; Don't worry prove yourself to yourself. we support you always.</p>
        <p class="text-right">XOXO</p>
